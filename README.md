# Contacts App

This project is the first react project requested from me within the scope of "Kodluyoruz Intermediate Frontend Web Development Course". It is a single page contacts application. It is built on a single component called "Contacts". "Contacts List" is updated using useState hooks. New contacts are added on top of the previous list. Because the page is not completely rendered. As you know this is a react project :)
